    "## Conclusion and Recommendations\n",
    "\n",
    "The analysis shows that the Capital Bikeshare system experiences clear imbalances across its stations.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Residential areas often show deficits with more departures than arrivals.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Office districts and tourist locations typically show surpluses as many riders end their trips there.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Events such as marches, parades, or political gatherings can cause strong short-term spikes at nearby stations.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Recommendations:**\n",
    "\n",
    "- Dynamic bike redistribution: Move bikes proactively from residential areas to central office/tourist stations in the morning and shift them back in the evening.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Event-based planning: Identify major events in advance (e.g. parades, political rallies, festivals) and pre-distribute bikes to nearby stations.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Pricing incentives: Offer reduced evening rates or special promotions for members to encourage bike use for return trips helping to reduce deficits at residential stations.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Introduce e-bikes: Providing more e-bikes can motivate riders to take bikes for the way home instead of switching to public transport when they are tired.\n",
    "\n",
    "Overall these measures can reduce imbalances and improve availability for all users. Also the service gets more reliable."
